# IoT-Based Solar Cell Tracking System

## Overview
This project is an IoT-powered solar tracking system designed to optimize the efficiency of solar energy collection. It adjusts the orientation of solar panels based on sunlight direction using a microcontroller and sensor-based tracking mechanism, with real-time data displayed through a web interface.

## Features
- Dual/single-axis solar tracking
- Real-time light intensity monitoring
- Voltage measurement of the solar panel
- IoT integration for data logging and visualization
- Web dashboard for live data and control

## Components
- Solar panel
- LDR sensors
- Servo motors (for rotation)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP32)
- Voltage sensors
- Wi-Fi module
- Web-based interface

## System Architecture
1. Sensors detect sunlight intensity from different directions.
2. The microcontroller processes the data and adjusts the panel's angle.
3. Voltage data and sunlight levels are sent to the web interface.
4. Users can monitor performance remotely.

## Installation
1. Connect hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.
3. Set up the web interface and connect it to the device via Wi-Fi.
4. Access the dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## Use Cases
- Residential solar power systems
- Remote solar installations
- Educational projects in renewable energy and IoT
